                <h2>An introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in <a href="https://fyrf.li/cE57m">Kingston, Jamaica</a>. I grew up there, went to school
                    there, graduated from college, worked for 15+ years ... before meeting and marrying my soul mate and
                    moving to the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After <a href="https://fyrf.li/dXWHP">high school</a>, I wanted to go to law school but I did not do
                    as well I could have in my high school examinations to make it in the <a
                        href="https://fyrf.li/BDzUz">Norman Manley Law School</a> at the <a
                        href="https://fyrf.li/8SJ5L">University of the West Indies</a>. My second application went to
                    the <a href="https://fyrf.li/aDz1o">University of Technology</a> (known as College of Arts, Science,
                    and Technology in those days) to study Computer Science. Considering how much I love computer and
                    technology, I think not getting into law school was probably for the best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I failed a couple of my college courses and was lazy about getting them retaken in time to graduate.
                    I went straight to work where I spent the next 8 or so years working with COBOL, Informix, and SCO
                    Unix. In fact, I am quite proud of my first project being a COBOL payroll program on a IBM system
                    36. I tell the story of having to process the payroll for St. Mary Banana and driving out with their
                    payroll on an 8-inch disk all the time. Even if it dates me, I am proud that my experiences have
                    given me exposure to all sorts and types of technologies and environments. By the time I was moving
                    to the United States, I have gained experience in Oracle and Informix and a few other technologies
                    based in sectors such as government finance, mortgage processing, and wireless telecommunications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I married into the US Military which meant jobs were going to be hard to find and keep due to the
                    moving around every 2-4 years. After trying to get back into wireless telecommunications, and having
                    to cut that short to move to Texas from Kentucky, I decided to look for remote jobs that would move
                    with me wherever we went. And thus began my new journey.

                <h2>Remote Work</h2>
                <p>
                    My first remote job was with <a href="https://fyrf.li/1Bj6V">Paradise Publishers</a> where I worked
                    on a few different websites doing very basic tasks such as quality assurance when new features were
                    being released, writing news posts and blogs, monitoring and moderating forums, operating the <a
                        href="https://fyrf.li/ZJKXC">help desk</a> when the regular help desk staff were out of office.
                    And then I was made "Editor-in-chief" of the <a href="https://fyrf.li/Ds1zL">ebooks site</a> that
                    Paradise Publishers owned at the time. I did very little editing save for suggesting basic changes
                    to manuscripts submitted to the site. My role was more of a librarian - ensuring quality and
                    readability of ebook submissions, as well as coordinating with authors about their books and their
                    plans for future submissions. Once in a while, I would do author write-ups for authors who were
                    prolific and I was given the weekly newsletter to manage after a year or two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After almost 5 years with Paradise Publishers, I was laid off. By this time, I had discovered a love
                    of writing and stories. I went back to school for a <a href="https://fyrf.li/SQvq0">Bachelor of
                        Communication</a> degree with a concentration in Intercultural Communication. As a part of the
                    curriculum, I discovered the art of <a href="https://fyrf.li/MLHQE">facilitative mediation</a> and
                    as a volunteer with the <a href="https://fyrf.li/G7u8c">Dispute Resolution Center of Thurston
                        County, Washington</a>, I completed 40 hours of training, the entrance exam, and all my
                    apprentice mediations. Unfortunately, another military move interfered with my official
                    certification as an independent mediator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was while performing mediations that I realised I rather liked the idea of helping people through
                    conflict and chaos and sought a path that would allow me to do so without needing to start from
                    scratch at a new dispute resolution centre. After much thought and consultations with friends,
                    family, and counselling professionals, I settled on a <a href="https://fyrf.li/CNg9G">"Master of
                        Social Work</a>. And since we were headed to Germany (with the military), an online degree was
                    going to be my best option. The only university that would cater to that requirement at the time was
                    the University of Southern California. And I was ecstatic when they accepted me.

                <h2>My extracurricular interests</h2>
                <p>
                    Even though my academic and professional path had strayed into the human services, I maintained my
                    interest and expertise in technology. While working with Paradise Publishers, and with the help of a
                    friend, I set up a home server and continue to work with Debian, Ubuntu, and several self-hosted
                    applications. Not the least of which was a blog that had seen several iterations over the years -
                    Movable Type, Mambo, and <a href="https://fyrf.li/jqaqL">Wordpress</a>.That home server has grown
                    exponentially since then. And while it isn't enterprise level hardware just yet, it still runs my
                    several projects quite well. In fact, this page was built and is hosted on that server. Written from
                    scratch with HTML and CSS and hosted on a Debian server running NGINX and php-fpm.

                <p>
                    I love taking photographs. I acquired a <a href="https://fyrf.li/GoUzq">Nikon D3000</a> back when it
                    was a brand new model and I still have it - in good working condition. Over the years, I have
                    collected a few different lenses and a few other accessories to expand my composition options. I
                    really like taking macro photographs and landscape scenes. I also take too many photos of my dogs,
                    Draega and Casper, and random images of my surroundings. I especially like to take still-life images
                    in black and white. I used to host my own photo gallery using an app I can no longer find online (I
                    think it was called Gallery 2?), and am currently trying to recreate it using <a
                        href="https://fyrf.li/HS44R">Piwigo</a>. That project has taken a bit of back seat in favour of
                    other things, not the least of which is some <a href="https://fyrf.li/9yy7Y">front end developer
                        courses</a> and certification.

                <p>
                    I used to read fiction voraciously before my Masters program. My favourite author for many years was
                    <a href="https://fyrf.li/xfsNF">Stephen King</a>. Since the Masters program, however, I find that my
                    reading has diminished quite a bit in favour of documentaries, non-fiction, and video gaming. I was
                    always a big gamer, but I still found time to read. So much so that it was more economical -
                    financially and space-wise - to get a <a href="https://fyrf.li/DbXU7">Kindle</a> to read on instead
                    of lugging around dozens of books wherever I went. Lately, I barely manage reading a book a month
                    where I used to polish off 4 or 5 in a month. I've found that a surprising number of people have had
                    the same experiences after doing an advanced degree. And it's more than a little comforting to know
                    that I am not alone there.

                    After two transatlantic moves, I am burnt out on so many things. And I find an almost exquisite
                    peace and satisfaction to sit around and experiment with self-hosted applications while I do <a
                        href="https://fyrf.li/9cDMs">contract work remotely</a>. My current job is low-stress,
                    low-demand but it uses up much of my technology and image processing skills. And I work at my own
                    pace and on my own time. That said, I am itching to get back into coding as it has always proven to
                    be highly rewarding and, as this website is intended to show, still quite a passion and a joy for
                    me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My homelab has grown to include self-hosted <a href="https://fyrf.li/k0FAX">rss aggregator</a>, a <a
                        href="https://fyrf.li/GBdan">Nextcloud</a> instance, a <a
                        href="https://fyrf.li/qTiYK">timekeeping
                        and invoicing app</a> for my current team of
                    contractors, a <a href="https://fyrf.li/sVfPj">NGINX proxy manager</a> installation, an <a
                        href="https://fyrf.li/0GyC9">article archiver</a>, a <a href="https://fyrf.li/ong4M">YOURLS</a>
                    installation, a Wordpress blog, this website, and <a href="https://fyrf.li/CUjGC">mailinabox</a>
                    installation.

                <p>
                    Finally, I am doing some course on Udemy.com to boost my front end development skills. At the
                    moment, I am working on <a
                        href="https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=2394680">Front End Developer
                        Bootcamp</a>. I am actually having a lot more fun than I thought I would be. The only problem I
                    am finding is that I stop the course to muck around in my <a
                        href="https://sandbox.fyrf.li">Sandbox</a> so I am lagging behind the projected end date for the
                    course. My goal is to learn enough of this stuff to actually be marketable as a front end developer
                    in the near future. Stay tuned to see how that works out for me.
