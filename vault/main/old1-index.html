		<h2> Current Sandbox Projects </h2>

		<section>
			<article>
				<h3> CSS Sandbox </h3>
				<p> This is where I spend my time learning how to make beautiful layouts. Right now, working on flex
					boxes.</p>
				<p> Click <a href="/css-sandbox/">here</a> to see what's cooking</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> My php playground</h3>
				<p> I have this project sitting on my back burner for decades now. It's basically a directory with
					lookup and editing capabilities. I have yet to get past the beginning stages of it and right now it
					is still completely useless. But, if you want to see the broken nonsense I've created, <a
						href="/lookup/"> click here</a></p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> fe - weird name, but I think I was in a hurry </h3>
				<p> This is where I put what I learn on Udemy to work. Basically practicing what I learn in a sandboxed
					environment so if I am going to break stuff, it is safe to do so without compromising anything else.
				</p>
				<p> Click <a href="/fe">here</a> to see what's currently being broken. </p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> flex-practice </h3>
				<p>This is where I was using some stuff from the Mozilla university to see how stuff worked. It's
					currently not in use but you can <a href="/flex-practice/flex001.html">click here</a> or <a
						href="flex-practice/flexbox-wrap01.html">here</a> to see what I was working on.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> grid work </h3>
				<p> Copied the flex documents over to here to start learning grid. Right now, it looks exactly like flex
					work but it'll start looking different in the coming days (Today is 2022-01-20) - so stay tuned.</p>
				<p><a href="grid-work">Click here</a> to see how it's going</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> staggered boxes </h3>
				<p> I am trying to work a design where the boxes flex with the screen but are staggered left, then
					right, then left again. It's giving me a headache but I am still trying. You can see my work in
					progress <a href="article-sectioning/">here</a>.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> multiple background images under scrolling text blocks</h3>
				<p> Putting multiple images in the background and having boxes of text scroll past them. It's a
					technique I see on some sites and have had no idea how they do it until now. So going to try my hand
					at working it out. <a href="multiple-background-images/">Click here</a> to see where I am at with
					it.</p>
