# What's this about?

This project is where I come to experiment with new techniques and skills. Some of these projects have been broken out into their own projects. At some point (probably when I have more complete and polished projects to show), I'll remove those and bring them back here.

It's also the starting point I made for [my coding journey](https://camille.fyrfli.io).
