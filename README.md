## Overview

This project is where I come to experiment with new techniques and skills. Some of these projects have been broken out into their own projects. At some point (probably when I have more complete and polished projects to show), I'll remove those and bring them back here.
## Sub-projects

I'll be adding new sub-projects as I go along. For now, these are the ones found under this project.

### Article Sectioning



### CSS Sandbox

### FE

### Flex Practice

### Grid Work

### Lookup

This is a now-failed attempt at a basic name directory written in php. I expect I'll return to it at some point.

### Multiple Background Images

I have this image of a page where there are mutiple background images fixed to the background and the text of the page scrolls past them, revealing a little bit of them in predefined spaces.

### Portfolio Sandbox

This is where I will work on creating a flat site portfolio for later use as an employment tool.
