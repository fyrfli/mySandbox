## Overview

This project is where I come to experiment with new techniques and skills. Some of these projects have been broken out into their own projects. At some point (probably when I have more complete and polished projects to show), I'll remove those and bring them back here.
## Sub-projects

I'll be adding new sub-projects as I go along. For now, these are the ones found under this project.

### Article Sectioning

HTML documents are to be sectioned according to specific guidelines - mostly for accessibility reason, but also for readability and CSS specificity. I spend some time in here experimenting with the different sections and specificity of my CSS selections.

### Box work

Flex, Grid, Standard, alternative - I play with all of them here.

### Boxes

This is where I have my CV in story form with background images fixed and the text scrolling passed them. It's juvenile and very very basic. It will need LOTS of work.

### CSS Menu

I want to create a menu purely out of CSS ... maybe some javascript later on but here is where I will work on that.
### FE

Some flex work that I used to work out the kinks in my knowledge

### Flex Box

#### Flex001

#### Flexbox Wrap01

### Grid Work

### Lookup

This is a now-failed attempt at a basic name directory written in php. I expect I'll return to it at some point.

### Multiple Background Images

I have this image of a page where there are mutiple background images fixed to the background and the text of the page scrolls past them, revealing a little bit of them in predefined spaces.

### Portfolio

This is where I will work on creating a flat site portfolio for later use as an employment tool.
