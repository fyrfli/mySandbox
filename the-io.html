		<h2> Current Sandbox Projects </h2>

		<section>
			<article>
				<h3> <a href="/css-sandbox/">CSS Sandbox</a> </h3>
				<p> This is where I spend my time learning how to make beautiful layouts. Right now, working on flex
					boxes.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> <a href="/lookup/">My php playground</a></h3>
				<p> I have this project sitting on my back burner for decades now. It's basically a directory with
					lookup and editing capabilities. Right now it is in a completely useless state.
					<hr> <strong>**Note**</strong>: <br /> there is no "Back home" link on this page
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> <a href="/fe">fe</a> </h3>
				<p> This is an odd name, but I think I was in a hurry. This is where I put what I learn on Udemy to
					work.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> <a href="/flex-practice/index.html">flex-practice</a> </h3>
				<p>This is where I was using some stuff from the Mozilla university to see how stuff worked. Currently
					not in use.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> <a href="grid-work">grid work</a> </h3>
				<p> Copied the flex documents over to here to start learning grid. Right now, it looks exactly like flex
					work but it'll start looking different in the coming days (Today is 2022-01-20) - so stay tuned.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> <a href="article-sectioning/">staggered boxes</a> </h3>
				<p> I am trying to work a design where the boxes flex with the screen but are staggered left, then
					right, then left again. It's giving me a headache but I am still trying.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> <a href="multiple-background-images/">multiple background images</a> </h3>
				<p> Putting multiple images in the background and having boxes of text scroll past them. It's a
					technique I see on some sites and have had no idea how they do it until now. So going to try my hand
					at working it out.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3> <a href="box-work">box work</a> </h3>
				<p> I made a separate sub-folder with the name "box-work" because I wanted to be able to play around
					with different box formats in one file. Right now, am just trying to get a hang of grids.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><a href="figures/">figure work</a></h3>
				<p> Playing with images as background with captions, etc. </p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><a href="boxes">scrolling boxes and fixed images</a></h3>
				<p>
					This effect is sort of what I was going for in <a href="article-sectioning/">staggered boxes</a>
					sans the "staggered" part. I created it as a separate project and then decided I wanted to showcase
					it here.
