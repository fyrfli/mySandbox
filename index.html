                        I have been working in technology for over 15 years. Much of my web technology work has been
                        purely based in terms of what I could learn on my own. Of course, I have formal training in
                        programming structure (I still remember wondering why we were being taught Pascal and BASIC when
                        no one actively uses it in the real world). But programming structure, while it is important to
                        know, really gets thrown out of the window these days with all the tools we have that do a lot
                        of that structure work for us. But the time has come for me to do some learning because if I
                        want to do this properly (and I have wanted to do this for a long LONG time; longer than I am
                        willing to admit out loud), then I need to stop making web pages with the Mozilla Reference
                        manuals open in 10 or more tabs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so, here I document my journey ... starting this February of 2022. Here I start to learn how
                        to make web pages like I have always wanted to and I will share my journey with you.

                            attribution) but I learned a lot and I enjoyed it immensely. That it was so easy kept me
                            going.

                            This challenge was a lot harder mostly because I wanted to get the responsiveness to work
                            just as the design showed and that required me to not only figure out how to get the flex to
                            behave properly, but also the border radius. The border radius changes when
                            the cards align
                            vertically.

                            And this challenge was so much fun. It's basically flex but spanning several grids. What I
                            did instead was just grid box and @media queries to alter the layout depending on screen
                            width. I feel like it could have been accomplished in a far more polished manner, though,
                            and I intend to revisit it several times over the journey. Stay tuned.

                            I started with mobile first styling and got it perfect. It was when I switched to desktop
                            styling that I started running
                            into issues. I think that I need more practice with this process before I get it right. The
                            solution looks presentable,
                            but there are overflows everywhere. I am going to submit this for help and hopefully be able
                            to sort it out afterwards.

                            This challenge was fairly easy to do since it incorporated techniques that I've been using
                            over the last few weeks. I had tons of fun coding this one especially since I did it the
                            right way straight-away - mobile-first.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an aside, this particular challenge reinforced the fact that I REALLY am loving this
                            journey and even though there is a mountain range of new stuff yet to learn, I am eager to
                            continue.

                            I am anxious to do as many challenges as I can from as many sources as I can to continually
                            practice these skills. So I searched for frontend developer challenges and found a few more
                            websites with challenges.

                                target="_blank">Piccalilli</a>. The tinting of the images was a challenge, but I
                            eventually figured it out. I'll need more practice, of course. I also discovered that the
                            actual solution was a lot more complex than mine. I will need to do some more work on this.

                            My resume is long and varied. I've spent a good deal of time working on how to make it
                            reflect who I am (and I think it could still use some work). And this is what got me started
                            on building web pages again. I tinker in my homelab for stress relief and I have
                            always derived pleasure in creating things ... especially webpages. I built my website from
                            scratch on Geocities back when the only tools we had were a modem
                            connecting and Windows Notepad. This was a natural direction for me.

                            In an effort to put some of these skills I am leaning into real practice, I decided I wanted
                            to build a site I have from scratch. I chose <a href="https://camillefrantz.me"
                                target="_blank">camillefrantz.me</a> as my first attempt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I initially established that website, I used <a href="https://gohugoio"
                                target="_blank">Hugo</a> to
                            build it. It was always supposed to be a static site so Hugo worked well. I've found I
                            needed to tweak it some over the years - I added the responsive cv under the sub-directory,
                            for one, and used a php function to give a current year on the bottom of the page. All this
                            made it the perfect option for a first-time, real-time project ... and here we are.
